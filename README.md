## DMP_Implementation 
Course project of ECE670. 

<!-- >> run: Record_Motion    -->
	run: Record_Motion
	(r : to generate waypoits, s: to save  them)
	Record the trajectory and save them

<!-- >> run: Main_DMP -->

	run: Main_DMP
	give the input of file were it was saved earlier step

	Outputs: Force f(x) estimation plots
<img src="Images/4.png">

	Figure 1 graph of force estimation wrt time plus spaneed version
	{estimation for both X and Y}
	estimating f(s) first from DMP equation	then usin that extract weights "wi"

Main_DMP generated weigts and extracted weigts into a new file "name_weigts.xlsx"

	Use the maniulator.m file at last to generate worksace value
	Load the file "load_weights" : Load the DMP Parametes in the workspace

	next step go to simulik;
	DMP Block: Canonical System Generation i.e. x,v,v' Fig1 of the paper

	Then we output refrence state i.e. joinstate variables; and design controller and system(repesetig dyamics)

	Use the visualizer(Manipulator.m) file to see the visulation
